## About This Project

As part of my embedded systems internship, I followed the [Linux Driver Tutorial](https://github.com/Johannes4Linux/Linux_Driver_Tutorial) to learn the fundamentals of Linux kernel module development.

While the original tutorial targets the Raspberry Pi, I adapted the code to work with the **Rockchip RV1106** platform. 

I referred to the RV1106 resources provided by [Ologn](https://github.com/ologn-tech) for kernel source setup and cross-toolchain support.
